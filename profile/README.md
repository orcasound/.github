<h2> Our Voyage Thus Far üß≠ </h2>

Since an [Orcasound Kickstarter in 2017](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/sveirs/orcasound-listen-for-whales), we have been building open source software here on Github to help save the endangered orcas that seek salmon along the west coast of North America. Experiencing the live sounds of wild killer whales and acting to help conserve them is at the üíó heart of our collective collaboration.

We began with the challenge of building an end-to-end audio live-streaming solution to make it easy to *listen for whales* through the [Orcasound network of underwater microphones](https://orcasound.net) ("hydrophones") in orca habitat. The [orcanode repo](https://github.com/orcasound/orcanode) generates the audio data streams and the [orcasite repo](https://github.com/orcasound/orcasite) provides a web app for playback that "just works" in any browser and scales efficiently. 

From the beginning, we have benefited greatly from the amazing all-volunteer **hackathon** community -- mainly through the organizational efforts of [DemocracyLab](https://www.democracylab.org/projects/81) and [Microsoft Garage](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/garage/) -- both through in-person events in/near Seattle (Washington, USA) as well as many virtual events during the COVID pandemic. Both Microsoft's [AI for Earth](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/ai-for-earth) program and [Amazon Activate](https://aws.amazon.com/activate/) have supported our efforts with grants and/or cloud service credits. Starting in 2020, we have mentored Google Summer of Code contributors in the [orcagsoc repo](https://github.com/orcasound/orcagsoc). 

<h2> On the Horizon (Updated Oct 2021) üó∫Ô∏è </h2>

See what's next on [Orcasound's public road map](https://trello.com/b/wBg0qhss/orcasound-roadmap). You can also suggest or vote up features!

Our long-term motivation is to make the [Orcasound web app](https://live.orcasound.net/) and our other projects into a more-and-more effective suite of conservation tools. Along the way, we are trying to be as open, modular, and foresightful as possible in the hope that what we build for orcas will help bioacousticans and conservationists study and save other soniferous species around the planet.

<h2> Welcome Aboard! üõ≥Ô∏è </h2>

Would you like to help save the orcas and contribute to open source software? 

The Orcasound organisation on Github has a growing number of projects to which you can contribute. We welcome **coders** (front/back end developers, bioacousticians, data scientists) and **designers** (and other *creatives*), as well as project managers, mentors, and hardware engineers. The [Orcasound community](https://www.orcasound.net/hacker-hall-of-fame/) is super-friendly, daily communication mainly happens on Slack ([you're invited!](https://join.slack.com/t/orcasound/shared_invite/zt-bd1jk2q9-FjeWr3OzocDBwDgS0g1FdQ)), and there are weekly virtual meetings where you can introduce yourself and hear what others are doing. 

Here is the [Current Volunteer Handbook](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GHuylE3qPm2UAyUA_f1yOtMgutBpXF6V/view?usp=sharing) where you can find more info about Orcasound's motivations, code of conduct, and high-priority projects.

See below for how you can join the Orcasound community and start contributing right away!

* <h3> Developers </h3>

	+ If you're interested in contributing code, we would welcome your input on any of our projects listed in the [Current Volunteer Handbook](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GHuylE3qPm2UAyUA_f1yOtMgutBpXF6V/view?usp=sharing). If you are interested in making a contribution to any of the listed projects, or would like to make a bigger commitment to Orcasound long-term, go ahead and introduce yourself in Orcasound's [#Dev-General](https://orcasound.slack.com/archives/C01HLLQ0UTG) Slack channel!

	+ Active github repositories for our high-priority projects are [Orcasite](https://github.com/orcasound/orcasite) for the Live Listening App, [Orcanode](https://github.com/orcasound/orcanode) for the Hydrophone Network software (running on Raspberry Pis), [aifororcas-livesystem](https://github.com/orcasound/aifororcas-livesystem) for work on an AI system to auto-detect sounds, [orcamap-react](https://github.com/orcasound/orcamap-react) for analyzing SRKW location data, and [orca-shipnoise](https://github.com/orcasound/orca-shipnoise) for creating shipnoise.net to address underwater noise pollution that can interfere with Orca communication. ***Please see each repo's CONTRIBUTING.md documents for details!***

* <h3> Machine Learning </h3>

	+ If you're interested in machine learning you can [access Orcasound's open data](https://github.com/orcasound/orcadata/wiki) and [peruse deployed project summaries at ai4orcas.net](https://ai4orcas.net/portfolio/) </p>
	+ How to download the training and testing data for ML models?
		+ Follow instructions in [Data access AWS CLI](https://github.com/orcasound/orcadata/wiki/Data-access-via-AWS-CLI) to download static ML data.
		+ If you have not used AWS CLI before, or if you want to learn more about the available buckets, proceed [here](https://github.com/orcasound/orcadata/blob/master/access.md) to read a high-level summery of the AWS buckets.
		+ A subset of Orcasound‚Äôs open labeled data includes data archives that were prepared via the Pod.Cast system. The [Pod.Cast data archive wiki page](https://github.com/orcasound/orcadata/wiki/Pod.Cast-data-archive) provides instructions on how to download Pod.Cast data. This is a good place to start if you want to take a look at the labeled data.
		+ If you want a python script to handle the data download, [download_datasets.py](https://github.com/orcasound/aifororcas-orcaml/blob/master/data_ml/tools/download_datasets.py) would help you with that.
	+ How to find the code for the latest model? 
		+ The current deployed model is called [OrcaHello live inference system](https://ai4orcas.net/portfolio/orcahello/). Its github repo is [aifororcas-livesystem](https://github.com/orcasound/aifororcas-livesystem). 
		+ To those who are interested in finetuning the current ML model, the [ModelTraining](https://github.com/orcasound/aifororcas-livesystem/tree/main/ModelTraining) folder in the aifororcas repo is where you want to start.


* <h3> Google Summer of Code Prospective Contributors </h3>

	+ If you're a prospective Google Summer of Code contributor, don't miss [Orcasound's GSoC project page](https://www.orcasound.net/portfolio/google-summer-of-code-open-source-software-for-students-orcas/) and [open source advice from Orcasound's past GSoC participants](https://github.com/orcasound/orcagsoc/blob/master/OPEN-SOURCE-best-practice+tips.md)!

 * <h3> UX/UI Designers </h3>

	+ If you're interested in contributing design, go ahead and introduce yourself in Orcasound's [#UX-General](https://orcasound.slack.com/archives/CE5KAK4D6) Slack channel and check out our current work in the [UX Team Documents Google Docs Folder!](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1RGAnSUuAfbjw4JjFzqswAvvn9Wz2v2dK?usp=sharing)

<sub>ü§´ Psst! You can create your own [organization README](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/customizing-your-organizations-profile).</sub>
