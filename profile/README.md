## Ahoy, this is Orcasound ðŸ‘‹

### Our voyage thus far

Since an [Orcasound Kickstarter in 2017](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/sveirs/orcasound-listen-for-whales), we have been building open source software here on Github to help save the endangered orcas that seek salmon along the west coast of North America. Experiencing the live sounds of wild killer whales and acting to help conserve them is at the ðŸ’— heart of our collective collaboration.

We began with the challenge of building end-to-end audio live-streaming solution to make it easy to *listen for whales* through the [Orcasound network of underwater microphones](https://orcasound.net) ("hydrophones") in orca habitat. The [orcanode repo](https://github.com/orcasound/orcanode) generates the audio data streams and the [orcasite repo](https://github.com/orcasound/orcasite) provides a web app for playback that "just works" in any browser and scales efficiently. 

From the beginning, we have benefited greatly from the amazing all-volunteer **hackathon** community -- mainly through the organizational efforts of [DemocracyLab](https://www.democracylab.org/projects/81) and [Microsoft Garage](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/garage/) through in-person events in/near Seattle (Washington, USA) as well as many virtual events during the COVID pandemic. Both Microsoft's [AI for Earth](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/ai-for-earth) program and [Amazon Activate](https://aws.amazon.com/activate/) have supported our efforts with grants and cloud service credits. Starting in 2020, we have mentored Google Summer of Code students here (see the [orcagsoc repo](https://github.com/orcasound/orcagsoc)). 

### Welcome aboard!

Would you like to help save the orcas and contribute to open source software? 

The Orcasound organisation on Github has a growing number of projects to which you can contribute. We welcome **coders** (front/back end developers, bioacousticians, data scientists) and **designers** (and other *creatives*), as well as project managers, mentors, and hardware engineers. The [Orcasound community](https://www.orcasound.net/hacker-hall-of-fame/) is super-friendly, daily communication mainly happens on Slack, and there are weekly virtual meetings where you can introduce yourself and hear what others are doing. 

Here is the [current onboarding doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Pjh5juthsG0sv7hYCtwgeXgNSlkmIt0p0bw17Y4VXco/edit#heading=h.qybrobkq5dm5) where you can find more info about our current motivations, high-priority projects, and how to join our community.

### On the horizon (updated Oct 2021) 

See what's next on [Orcasound's public road map](https://trello.com/b/wBg0qhss/orcasound-roadmap). You can also suggest or vote up features!

Our long-term motivation is to make the [Orcasound web app](https://live.orcasound.net/) and our other projects into an more-and-more effective suite of conservation tools. Along the way, we are trying to be as open, modular, and foresightful as possible in the hope that what we build for orcas will help bioacousticans and conservationists study and save other soniferous species around the planet.
